Questions for Client

1. What directory do you want the generated files to be written to? Currently /tmp is used as it is not clear if the generated reports should be kept forever or if a batch process would come by to collect them.
2. For $sysdate in the generated file names, do you want seconds, minutes and hours included?
3. Should generated files be accessible by other users who use the client software?
4. Should generated files be viewable inside of the Apache web server?
5. Should ID auto-populate with an ID based on what the previous ID used was?
6. Should START_DATE auto-populate with today's date?
